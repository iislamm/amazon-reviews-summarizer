    "## Problem Description and Background\n",
    "Companies and big businesses which offer online products face problems when analyzing the feedback of their customers. Usually, the feedback has a lot of unnecessary text in it. The long feedback is harder to analyze and consumes a huge amount of time.\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "The solution is to develop a learning agent to solve the problem. The agent is a deep learning model that summarizes the feedback using NLP techniques with Recurrent Neural Network to understand the context of the text and generate a summarization of the feedback text.\n",
